# need to get the right python... we have to update the line above if
# python moves (sigh).  /usr/bin/env python3 wouldn't work for me
# when this is called as a crontab (even though it works when called
# as a user).  Only thing I found that worked was hardwiring the path

# this program creates a list of recent papers citing the Psi4 1.1 paper
