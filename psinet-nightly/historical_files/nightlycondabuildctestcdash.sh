#   arrangments conda provides are for the *installed* entity whereas the ctest
#   facilities needed for a CDash submission are present in the *build* entity.

#   every invocation of conda-build) and proceeds to build it according

#   $CONDAINSTALLDIR. When this completes successfully, it zips up the
