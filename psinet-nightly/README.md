psinet nightly
--------------
[CDS 11 Sept 2018]

I have split out the handling of the github feed into its own scripts, and I have added a feed of recent articles that cite Psi4.  The scripts to do this, like the scripts below, are run nightly on psinet.

```
45 14 * * 3 bash /home/psilocaluser/gits/psi4meta/recent-citing-articles/parse_gs_psi4_refs.py > /home/psilocaluser/gits/psi4meta/recent-citing-articles/error.log 2>&1
50 * * * * bash /home/psilocaluser/gits/psi4meta/github-feed/parse_gh_commits.py > /home/psilocaluser/gits/psi4meta/github-feed/error.log 2>&1
55 * * * * bash /home/psilocaluser/gits/psi4meta/psinet-nightly/push_feed.sh >>/home/psilocaluser/gits/psi4meta/psinet-nightly/push_feed.log 2>&1
```

The first script grabs recent articles that cite Psi4, and creates two files, articles.txt and most_recent_article.txt.  Note it is invoked with bash, to help it find an appropriate python.

The second script grabs recent commits to github, and puts them in commits.txt and most_recent_commimt.txt

The third script pushes these text files from psinet to psicode.net so that the files are locally available for inclusion
in the website.

Duties of build script in entry below unchanged, but moved to (nu)psinet which we're handling out-of-networked-disk

```

```

[LAB 23 March 2017]

* [psinet-nightly/kitandkapoodle.py](kitandkapoodle.py)

  * Uses a dedicated py36 miniconda installation for builds.
  * Always builds in scratch ``CONDA_BLD_PATH=/scratch/cdsgroup/conda-builds/``
  * Has setup to build most of the ecosystem packages, but by default builds the 3 psi4 ones, incl. docs build with py35.
  * Reports back package build status:
    * `NoBuild` --- conda-build failed in build or test
    * `Success` --- conda package built and uploaded to anaconda.org
    * `NoUpload` --- conda package built but upload rejected b/c already posted
    * `NoFile` --- conda package built but package file not found

[LAB 21 March 2017]

* [psinet-nightly/handle_sphinxman.sh](handle_sphinxman.sh)

  * The Linux+Py35 conda build deposits sphinxman, feed, and doxygen tarballs into folder `psicode_dropbox/` on psinet.
  * The above script checks for those tarballs every 7 min, then sends them to psicode.org (sshkey auth) and upon success deletes them.
  * psinet crontab: `11,26,41,56 * * * * bash /theoryfs2/ds/cdsgroup/psi4-compile/psi4meta/psinet-nightly/handle_sphinxman.sh >>/theoryfs2/ds/cdsgroup/psi4-compile/psi4meta/psinet-nightly/psicode-dropbox.log 2>&1`
  * On psicode.org, [psicode-feedsfrom-psinet/handle_sphinxman.sh](../psicode-feedsfrom-psinet/handle_sphinxman.sh) checks for tarballs every 15 min and unpacks them into position.

Assume everything below this section marker is out of date (i.e., 1.0-era).

* ``nightlycondabuildctestcdash.sh`` is run nightly from a crontab

```bash
00 02 * * * /theoryfs2/ds/cdsgroup/psi4-compile/nightly/nightlycondabuildctestcdash.sh >/theoryfs2/ds/cdsgroup/psi4-compile/nightly/cb-psinet.log 2>&1
```

* It does:

  * Build of Linux conda package from fresh ``psi4/psi4`` checkout
  * If a few test cases pass, upload conda package to anaconda.org
  * Run **all** test cases, send results to testboard.org
  * Make docs. If successful, tgz and send to psicode for "docs" link in header
  * Make github feed. If successful, tgz and send to psicode for single commit on main page and recent history on ``timeline.php``

* Many comments in script itself

* Accessible to anyone with a cdsgroup account after talking about some details.

* **Takeaway: everything built from private repo at 2 AM**

* Fork conda package so users can subscribe just to psi4 channel
  * >>> ``~/psi4-install/miniconda/bin/anaconda copy asmeurer/gsl/1.16/linux-64/gsl-1.16-1.tar.bz2``

* 23 January 2016

  * fresh miniconda installation
    * `conda install conda-build=1.18.0`  # current is 1.18.2 but they changed their jinja2 parsing and our versioning hasn't been updated to compatibility
    * `conda install jinja2`
    * `conda install anaconda-client`  # needed to upload to anaconda.org
    * unnecessary for me since login transferred from prev installation, but generally `anaconda login`
